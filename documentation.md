Expand on this README to include as much detail about your project as is
possible and necessary.
a. README files are an essential piece of documentation to include in any
project. They give anyone looking at your application or reading your code
a reference for how it works.
2. Please include the following details:
a. The title of your site and a link to the URL where it is deployed

process.
